# Todo

- [ ] return statements
- [ ] break/continue (with labels)
- [ ] labeled blocks
- [ ] type constructors (syntax and implementation)
- [ ] full type coercian
- [ ] access operator (.)
- [ ] fix diagnostic messages (i think spans are fine, just the messages)
- [x] add checks to make sure that user types are actually valid/defined
- [ ] start work on IR forms
- [ ] reorganize code / general cleanup
- [ ] make universal function for creating "compilation units" instead of just calling piecemeal
- [ ] decide whether or not to use semicolons in struct type declerations
- [ ] decide on the syntax for tagged unions / sum types
- [ ] add generics
- [ ] add impl blocks
- [ ] add lifetimes
