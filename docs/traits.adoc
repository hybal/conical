= Traits
:hardbreaks:

[NOTE]
Traits may change name do distinguish between rust, but that will depend on if they are different or not.

A *trait* in Conical is just a collection of function signatures and optional bodies that can be used on a struct to allow dynamic dispatch (running arbitrary functions at runtime)
They are created with the `trait` keyword followed by the name of the trait and a body with function declarations.
[source, conical]
----
trait Show {
    //function declarations
}
----

Within a trait you can use inline or postfix or external type syntax for the function declarations. Though external is usually favored for its readability
[source, conical]
----
trait Show {
    fn to_string :: (&Self, Allocator) -> &str; //external syntax - recommended
    fn to_string(&self, allocator) :: (&Self, Allocator) -> &str; //postfix
    fn to_string(&self, allocator: Allocator) -> &str; //inline
}
----

To implement a trait for a type you can use an impl block.
[source, conical]
----
/... the previous Show trait definition
struct Foo {
    a: i32;
    b: i32;
}

impl Show for Foo {
    fn to_string(&self, allocator: Allocator) -> &str {
        //... converting the struct to a string
    }
}
----

now you can use the trait as a type to take in any type that implements that trait.
[source, conical]
----
fn print(value: Show?) {
    value.to_string().printn!();
}
