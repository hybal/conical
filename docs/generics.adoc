= Generics
:hardbreaks:

Generics are a way to define logic and data that is independent of type.
They are declared using `$id` and afterwards can be used as a normal type.

fn add(a, b): ($T, T) -> T => a + b;

struct Vec {
    data: $T[],
    len: usz
}

enum Option {
    Some($T),
    None
}
----
This creates a function that can take any value that supports the add operator.

Generics are expanded at compile time, essentially creating a custom function for every type that is used.
For the most part the compiler can infer the type to set the generic, however if it cannot then they can be passed manually.

fn div(a, b): (i32, i32) -> Option(i32) {
    if b == 0 {

    }
