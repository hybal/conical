# Set Definition

The definition of a set in Conical is as follows:

A _set_ is a collection of items (called elements) that follow two rules:

1. There are no duplicates
2. There is no ordering of items in the set itself

There also exists an _empty set_ which is the set that has no elements - represented as $`\{\}`$, or $`\emptyset`$.
This set can also be referred to as the _unit_ set or just unit.
