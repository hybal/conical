# Design Philosophy

There are three operating principles for the design of conical:

1. If a specific feature can be implemented using a general approach, that approach should be taken.

1. The compiler should be able to reliably enforce as many assumptions as realisticly possible.

1. The language should not assume a single, specific use-case. Rather it should allow for granularity.
